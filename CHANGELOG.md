# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-15

  conversations. Includes:

    - Track table: one row per Individual/BUS track + Full Mix row 
      with full loudness, spectral, stereo, tonal, and temporal metrics
    - Mix Health Score breakdown (reuses existing scoring engine)
    - Per-family aggregates (Drums, Bass, Synth, etc.) with mean, std, 
      and consensus dominant band
- AI Context sheet integrated with M7.5 navigation bar
- AI Context listed in Index sheet special links
- New `encode_anomalies()` helper for compact anomaly encoding
- New `docs/` folder with sheet specification and design prompt
